        The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living
        terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally
        considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine
        subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species
        has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear
        DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species
        are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. The giraffe's chief
        distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its
        horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified
        under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the
        okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa
        in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.</p> 
        <p>Giraffes
        usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves,
        fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they
        browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes may be
        preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs.
        Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor
        herds of unsrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large
        aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which
        are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain
        mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising
        the young.</p>
    </p>The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and
        modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in
        paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International
        Union for Conservation of Nature as vulnerable to extinction, and has been
        extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found
        in numerous national parks and game reserves but estimates as of 2016
        indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the
        wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.
